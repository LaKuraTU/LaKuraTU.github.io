This website was developed as part of the course “Psychological Interventions Using Digital Technologies” by Laura Funke, Nadine Schmer, and Vanessa Komar.

The code for the website design was adapted from the [Clearinghouse website of the TU Munich](https://www.clearinghouse.edu.tum.de/).

Graphics for the research papers “Treating Childhood Social Anxiety Disorder With Virtual Environments and Serious Games” and “Gamification as an Approach to Improve Resilience and Reduce Attrition in Mobile Mental Health Interventions” were designed using DALL-E.
