# Website README

This website was developed as part of the course “Psychological Interventions Using Digital Technologies” by Laura Funke, Nadine Schmer, and Vanessa Komar. The primary goal of this project is to explore and present innovative digital approaches to psychological interventions.

The code for the website design was adapted from the [Clearinghouse website of the TU Munich](https://www.clearinghouse.edu.tum.de/). The original design was tailored to meet the specific needs and objectives of our course project.

Graphics for the research papers “Treating Childhood Social Anxiety Disorder With Virtual Environments and Serious Games” and “Gamification as an Approach to Improve Resilience and Reduce Attrition in Mobile Mental Health Interventions” were designed using DALL-E.

This text was written using ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI.
